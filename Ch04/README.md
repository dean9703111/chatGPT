- ➤ 中文面試官
    `我希望你能擔任一個面試官，我將是候選人，你將向我提出 Node.js Backend Developer 職位的面試問題。我希望你像是面試官一樣的回應，不要一次問完所有問題。我希望你只對我進行面試，問我問題，並等待我的回答，不要額外的解釋。像面試官那樣一個一個地問我問題，並等待我的回答就好。我的第一句話是 "你好"`

    `我的名字是 Dean，目前是一名 Senior Backend Developer，熟悉 Node.js 的 Express 框架以及 MySQL 資料庫等技術。`

    `有 5 年的開發經驗，期間完成多個系統，比如線上打卡系統、線上測驗系統、購物車系統。`

    `過去採用 K8s 技術，可以根據實際的流量來做 autoscaling。`

- ➤ 英文面試官
    `I want you to act as an interviewer. I will be the candidate and you will ask me the interview questions for the Node.js Backend Developer position. I want you to only reply as the interviewer. Do not write all the conservation at once. I want you to only do the interview with me. Ask me the questions and wait for my answers. Do not write explanations. Ask me the questions one by one like an interviewer does and wait for my answers. My first sentence is "Hi"`

    `I have 5 years of experience in Node.js development, during which I have successfully completed a variety of systems, such as an punch-in system, an online exam system, and online shopping system.`

    `In the online shopping system project, we faced the challenge of high concurrency. To guarantee a seamless user experience and maintain system stability, I introduced Redis, a memory database, as a solution.`

    `I am familiar with multiple frameworks such as Express, Koa, AdonisJS. I hold the belief that frameworks are just means to an end, and the ability to solve problems is more important.`

    `Upon receiving a bug report, my initial step is to reproduce the user's actions in the development environment to clarify the issue, and use console.log to identify which part is causing the problem, allowing me to effectively narrow down the error's scope.`

    `I utilize MongoDB for handling big data, as it offers excellent performance and low scalability costs, and offers great flexibility of adding new columns.`

    `The first step is to identify which areas of the application are causing performance issues. If the problem in database queries, I would check table index design or use caching to store frequently accessed data in memory to reduce the load on the database and improve performance.`

    `It is an honor to participate in this interview and I look forward to the opportunity to work together in the future.`

I want you to replace my simplified A0-level words and sentences with more beautiful and elegant, upper level English words and sentences. Keep the meaning same, but make them more literary. I want you to only reply the correction, the improvements and nothing else, do not write explanations. My first sentence is "請給我“How Positive Thinking is Undermining America”這本書的重點摘要，以及適合閱讀的對象。"`

`Please give me a summary of the key points and the appropriate audience for the book "Bright-Sided: How Positive Thinking is Undermining America".And I want you to act as traditional chinese translator.`
